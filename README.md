# SRE (Site Reliability Engineering) Process

---

## Introduction

Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) applies software engineering principles to operations to build scalable and highly reliable systems. SRE ensures system availability, reduces toil, and drives continuous improvement—striking a balance between innovation velocity and risk management.

This repository offers a step-by-step learning path with hands-on exercises and supporting topics that introduce core SRE concepts, practices, and tooling. Each section contains clear objectives along with real-world examples for both aspiring and experienced SRE professionals.

## Getting Started

Before beginning any exercise or topic, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cguilencr/sre-abc-training.git
cd sre-abc-training
```

## Learning Path

1. **Start with the Topics (Topic 0 to Topic 4):**  
   These foundational concepts are essential for understanding SRE principles before diving into practical labs.

2. **Proceed Through the Exercises Sequentially (Exercise 1 to Exercise 19):**  
   The exercises build upon each other, guiding you from application creation and packaging to comprehensive monitoring, automation, and resilience engineering.

---

## Final Objectives

- Learn and apply key SRE concepts in real-world labs.
- Deploy a containerized application and set up monitoring and alerting.
- Automate infrastructure management using tools like Ansible, Helm, and Terraform.
- Practice GitOps with ArgoCD and CI/CD with GitHub Actions.
- Run chaos experiments to enhance system resilience.
- Manage tasks using GitHub Projects with a production-oriented mindset.
